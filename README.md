ClickToTalk_Sesli
=================

A flexible interface for people with speech impairment, Konuşma Engelliler için geliştirilebilir Arabirim.

Instead of typing letters to form words, the interface is for clicking on words to form sentencses.

Ideally engine should have 500-1000 most common words, each page have 36 slots, this would make the 
app need around 15-30 pages to operate smoothly.

Can be hosted and be run over a tablet without any setup.

With audio files, the user could record while still speaking.


With 3G it would work everywhere.


Improvments to make:

Interface:

- make speak words optional
- clear sentence button
- backspace for words
- change screen data to an xml based format
- add pages for more words
- collect more icons

- In Turkish words change based on person (I, you, he/she, We..) allow for interface to compensate for this.
